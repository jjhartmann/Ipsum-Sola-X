<a id="what-is-ipsum-sola" class="anchor" href="#what-is-ipsum-sola" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Ipsum Sola?</h2>

<p>Ipsum Sola is an experimental performance platform being developed to address specific issues in electronic music performativity. Specifically, it looks to enhance the performers ability to manipulate audio streams in a sonically interesting and dynamic way. </p>

<p>In order to do this, Ipsum Sola uses the power of parallel  processing to render incoming audio, live samples, or pre-set samples through various effect processes. On board there are a total of 8 parallel lines: Glitch Delay, BitCrusher, Ring Modulator, Glitch Factory 1, Glitch Factory 2, Morphology (Granularization), and Dry Out. </p>

<p>A detailed list of the effect region are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Glitch Delay</strong>
Create extreme, sharp, long, short, or moving delays that can be pushed to extreme levels. This predictably unpredictable delay line can easily make massively moving sonic gestures</p>

<p><strong>BitCrusher</strong>
Create static and noise by tearing the audio apart sample by sample. Paired with its own distortion, it can create interesting dynamic textures. </p>

<p><strong>Ring Modulator</strong>
A ring modulator with a difference. Manipulate various incoming audio paths by multiplying their waveforms with other audio streams, itâ€™s not just a single sine tone. </p>

<p><strong>Glitch Factory 1 &amp; 2</strong>
Both of these processors slice up local or live sampled tracks to create interesting beat sequences. Controlling the playback slice speed will generate different and interesting textures. </p>

<p><strong>Morphology</strong>
Unlock the hidden secrets or your sample by infinitely slowing the sample down to extract its pure sonic essences.  </p>

<p>Note: The user manual will  reveal more in-depth details and controllability.  </p>

<p>Midi and OSC
Virtually all controls in Ipsum Sola can be paired and used with either a MIDI controller or OSC interface. </p>
