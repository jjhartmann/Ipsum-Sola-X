Specifically, it looks to enhance the performers ability to manipulate audio streams in a sonically interesting and dynamic way. \r\n\r\nIn order to do this, Ipsum Sola uses the power of parallel  processing to render incoming audio, live samples, or pre-set samples through various effect processes. On board there are a total of 8 parallel lines: Glitch Delay, BitCrusher, Ring Modulator, Glitch Factory 1, Glitch Factory 2, Morphology (Granularization), and Dry Out. \r\n\r\n\r\nA detailed list of the effect region are as follows:\r\n\r\n**Glitch Delay**\r\nCreate extreme, sharp, long, short, or moving delays that can be pushed to extreme levels. This predictably unpredictable delay line can easily make massively moving sonic gestures\r\n\r\n**BitCrusher**\r\nCreate static and noise by tearing the audio apart sample by sample. Paired with its own distortion, it can create interesting dynamic textures. \r\n\r\n**Ring Modulator**\r\nA ring modulator with a difference. Manipulate various incoming audio paths by multiplying their waveforms with other audio streams, itâ€™s not just a single sine tone. \r\n\r\n**Glitch Factory 1 & 2**\r\nBoth of these processors slice up local or live sampled tracks to create interesting beat sequences. Controlling the playback slice speed will generate different and interesting textures. \r\n\r\n**Morphology**\r\nUnlock the hidden secrets or your sample by infinitely slowing the sample down to extract its pure sonic essences.  \r\n\r\nNote: The user manual will  reveal more in-depth details and controllability.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMidi and OSC\r\nVirtually all controls in Ipsum Sola can be paired and used with either a MIDI controller or OSC interface. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
